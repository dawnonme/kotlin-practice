#kotlin-practice
##What is it?
This is a project which aims to improve my Kotlin programming skill. In this project, I will use Kotlin to implement some algorithms and write some interesting programs.
##Why Kotlin?
Firstly, of course, I'm using Kotlin heavily in my work. Secondly and most importantly, I never saw a programming language that could fuse functional programming so well with the traditional coding scheme.
##What is the target?
Become a good Kotlin programmer, improve my problem-solving skill, perform better in my work, and most importantly, make myself stronger.
##Finally..
Enjoy this journey!
